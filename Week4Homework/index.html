            <h3>I'm not "<em>kidding</em>" around when I say, 'I love goats!'</h3>
            <p>Why do I love goats? I'll tell you why...</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I worked with them when I first started being a zookeeper.
                        <ul>
                            <li>I learned a lot from working with goats that helped me advance in my career and they'll always have a special place in my heart as the first animals I got to work with.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>They are diverse!
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are over 300 distinct breeds of goats. Some many different sizes, colors, and personalities!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>They make me laugh!
                        <ul>
                            <li>I can just look at them and they make me giggle. They have crazy eyes, fat bellies, and make weird noises. What's not to love?</li>
                            <li>Need more than a glance to make you laugh?
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ever seen a goat faint? <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI4hzzepEcI">Check this out</a>!</li>
